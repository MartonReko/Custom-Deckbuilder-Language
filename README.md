# Custom Deckbuilder Language

Welcome to the Custom Deckbuilder Language project!

This project was developed as part of the **Project Laboratory** course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

# Overview

The goal of this project is to create a **domain-specific language (DSL)** that allows users to describe a roguelike, turn-based game, where cards represent various in-game actions.

The project was inspired by the mechanics of _Slay the Spire_.

# Features

  + **Lexical and semantic analysis** using **ANTLR4** and **C#**.
