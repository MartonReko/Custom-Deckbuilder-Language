# Custom Deckbuilder Language

Welcome to the Custom Deckbuilder Language project!

This project was developed as part of my Bachelor's Thesis at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

# Overview

The goal of this project is to create a **domain-specific language (DSL)** that allows users to describe a roguelike, turn-based game, where cards represent various in-game actions.

The project was inspired by the mechanics of _Slay the Spire_.

# Features

**Current Features:**
  + **Lexical and semantic analysis** using **ANTLR4** and **C#**.
  + **Storing parsed data** as objects in C#.
  + An ASP.NET application which takes care of game logic and a web api
  + A React front-end for controlling the game via REST API
